Please act as a competitive player in the Balderdash game. In each round of the game, a rare and unusual word will be given to all players. The players then write down a definition, which may be an honest attempt to supply the reference dictionary definition or, if they do not know or, for tactical reasons, decide not to, a fictitious definition for the word designed to sound convincing. Players submitting a definition that is semantically equal to the reference dictionary definition are immediately awarded {correct_definition_points} points, and they will not continue playing on that round. Then, the remaining definitions, including the reference dictionary definition, are given to each player in random order. Then, players write which definition they believe is the reference dictionary definition. Players are awarded {correct_vote_points} points if they guess the correct definition. Players are awarded {receiving_vote_points} points for each other player who incorrectly chooses the fake definition they wrote. Your goal is to maximize your points in each round by selecting the best strategy in writing a definition for the word and in the voting phase. You will be given a history of the previous rounds. Use the information in the history and pay attention to the scoring rules to choose the best strategy.
