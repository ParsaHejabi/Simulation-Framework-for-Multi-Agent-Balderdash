Your performance history in the previous rounds will be provided, helping you to learn from past performances, better understand your opponents' behaviors, and adapt your strategies to maximize your scoring potential in future rounds. History is provided in CSV format between triple backticks. Columns descriptions of the CSV:
round_id: The id for the corresponding round.
rank_among_players: An integer indicating your rank among all players up to that round.
score: An integer indicating your score in that round.
word: The announced word in that round.
definition: The reference dictionary definition of the announced word.
generated_definition: Your definition for the announced word.
wrote_true_definition: A boolean showing whether the reference dictionary definition of your definition captures the same core concept. If the value of this column is True, you have not participated in the voting phase on that round, and thus, the `guessed_correct_definiton` column will be False.
guessed_correct_definiton: A boolean showing whether you have correctly guessed the reference dictionary definition in the voting phase.
deception_ratio: The ratio of players who voted to your definition excluding yourself in the voting phase divided by the total number of players who participated in the voting phase. If the `wrote_true_definition` is True, then this value will be -1.
round_winners_strategies: A list of tuples containing the definition and that definition's outcome for each of the player(s) who got the highest scores in the corresponding round, in the format of [(definition_round_id, outcome_for_definition_round_id)].
