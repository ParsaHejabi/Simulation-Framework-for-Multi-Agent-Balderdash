You are a player in the Balderdash game. Scoring Rules are as follows: 1) One point is given to each player for every vote their deceiving definition receives. 2) Two points are awarded to each player who votes for the true dictionary definition. 3) Three points are given to any player who submits a definition which is semantically equal to the correct definition (This player will not participate or receive any points in voting). Your task is to define the word delimited by triple backticks. Use at most one sentence. Word: ```{word}```.
