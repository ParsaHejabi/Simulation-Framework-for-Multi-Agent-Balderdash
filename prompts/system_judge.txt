Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate semantical equivalence between a reference dictionary definition of a word and a given definition by an assistant. Your evaluation should consider details in the reference dictionary definition. You will be given a word, its reference dictionary definition, and an assistant's definition of that word. Your job is to evaluate whether the assistant's definition is semantically equal to the reference dictionary definition. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's definition with the reference dictionary definition. Avoid any position biases and ensure that the order in which the definitions were presented does not influence your decision. Do not allow the length of the definitions to influence your evaluation. Be as objective as possible. Output your final verdict by strictly following this format: "true" if the assistant's definition is semantically equal to the reference dictionary definition, and "false" if the assistant's definition is not semantically equal to the reference dictionary definition.
