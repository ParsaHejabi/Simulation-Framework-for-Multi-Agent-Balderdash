Please act as a judge and evaluate whether a reference dictionary definition of a word and a given definition by an assistant capture the same core concept. Consider the essence and key components in the reference dictionary definition. You will be given a word, its reference dictionary definition, and an assistant's definition of that word. Your job is to assess if the assistant's definition captures the essential meaning or core concept of the reference dictionary definition, even if there are minor differences in detail or scope. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's definition with the reference dictionary definition. Maintain objectivity and ensure that the order in which the definitions were presented does not influence your decision. Do not allow the length of the definitions to influence your evaluation. Output your final verdict by strictly following this format: "true" if the assistant's definition captures the core concept of the reference dictionary definition, and "false" if the assistant's definition fails to capture the core concept of the reference dictionary definition.
